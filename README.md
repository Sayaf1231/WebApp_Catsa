This web-App is an aspiration to be a social media page where users can upload photos of their cats and make post about it
This web-app allows users to log-in using google authentication; so users can use their google account to log in.
This also allows user to make a porfile and set a profile photo.

Although the project is missing css; which is why it is not completely done. 
The development of CSS in progress and it should be done anytime soon!!!! 
Thank you for showing appreciation to me an cats :) :) :)
